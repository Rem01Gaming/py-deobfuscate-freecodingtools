# What is this?
![freecodingtools.org obfuscated script sample](./.assets/sample.png)
A shell script for deobfuscate obfuscated python script by [freecodingtools.org](https://freecodingtools.org/py-obfuscator). even the website says _'this method makes it difficult for hackers to gain access to your sensitive source code.'_, a random 15yo just casually cracked this open like it was nothing.

## How this work?
```yaml
1. Replace 'exec' to 'print`
2. Run the script like usual but append to temp file
3. Grep encrypted script chunk from temp file
4. Compiles the decryption script with the script chunk
5. Loop from step 2 until there's no string 'exec' on temp file
```

## Usage
```shell
bash py-deobfuscate.sh example.py
```
